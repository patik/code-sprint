                        When we work on projects today, we're working on many things at once — never really focused, always have a distraction. Hit a snag? Tempting to work on something else for a bit.

                        Project deadlines are easy to let slip when something else comes up.

                        This is how slow-moving companies work.

                        It isn't how startups work. We can look to startups for inspiration.

                        They get a lot done with fewer resources. Some of them even disrupt entire industries.

                        Putting together a SWAT team is much easier with ITS since we can now draw resources from across clusters.

                        Give that team a clear, singular goal, and take away their distractions. Make it a good goal, something that will produce real, usable results.

                        So why am I talking about this now in 2013? Why hasn't this been the standard for years?

                        Development tools have matured and are now largely cross-platform. A lot of things are web-based.

                        We are not tied to our desks. We can work in the same room, or remotely. Each has its benefits, but ultimately everything comes back to one place.

                        ITS has already had a few successful code sprints. A specific SWAT team was put together for each of these.

                        The Open Data initiative opened a slew of APIs to the public. An immense amount of public data suddenly became, well, public.

                        The DMV wanted it to make it easier for people to renew their registration, which of course means making that application available on all devices. A responsive design was the goal.

                        These were both accomplished in just a couple of weeks.

                        Last spring, a 3-week code sprint focused on responsive web design.

                        Not only did we make a proof of concept site, Go Responsive, to show how several different UI patterns can work in a responsive manner...

                        We even redesigned an entire agency site for the Division of Tax Appeals.

                        And if that wasn't enough, we put together an entire toolkit for making responsive sites.

                        Excelsior has already been used to make several more NYS sites.

                        So what was it like?

                        My experience working on the responsive web design SWAT team was incredible. It was pretty much non-stop action for the whole three weeks.

                        About a dozen of us got together for it. We started off brainstorming ideas about what designing responsively means, what a web site needs to perform well across a multitude of devices.

                        We organized all those things on a big poster board and started to code.

                        We knew we were expected to make a web framework and use that to launch a proof-of-concept site. That clear focus kept us on task.

                        There are so many rabbit holes that are very tempting for developers to jump down -- performance optimizations, adding extra bells and whistles. (Not testing, though, we let the users do that.)

                        But with a well-defined goal, and a project lead to keep us on task, we were able to stay on target.

                        As I said, this was a pretty intense 3 weeks. That intensity drove all of us to keep working.

                        The deadline loomed over us, but in a good way, a way that drove us to keep working -- we all *wanted* this project to succeed.

                        We knew that responsive design was the way the state needed to go, and this was our chance to prove it would work. That desire was instrumental to our success.
