                        Putting together a SWAT team is much easier now with ITS since we can draw resources from across clusters.

                        Give that team a clear, singular goal, and take away their distractions. Make it a good goal, something that will produce real, usable results.

                        To put it simply, we have GitHub.

                        More specifically, developers tools have matured and are no largely cross-platform. A lot of things are web-based.

                        We have one place with all of our code. One place for issue tracking. We are not tied to our desks.

                        We can work in the same room, or remotely. Each has its benefits, but ultimately everything comes back to one place.

                        ITS has already had a few successful code sprints. A specific SWAT team was put together for each of these.

                        The Open Data initiative opened a slew of APIs to the public. An immense amount of public data suddenly became, well, public.

                        The DMV wanted it to make it easier for people to renew their registration, which of course means making that application available on all devices. A responsively-designed version of the site was created in just a couple weeks.

                        A 3-week code sprint focused on responsive web design.

                        Not only did we make a proof of concept site, Go Responsive, to show how several different UI patterns can work in a responsive manner...

                        We even redesigned an entire agency site, the Division of Tax Appeals.

                        And if that wasn't enough, we put together an entire toolkit for making responsive sites. That's already been used to make several more NYS sites.

                        My experience working on the responsive web design SWAT team was incredible. It was pretty much non-stop action for the whole three weeks.

                        About a dozen of us got together for it. We started off brainstorming ideas about what designing responsively means, what a web site needs to perform well across a multitude of devices. We organized all those things on a big poster board and started to code.

                        We knew we were expected to make a proof-of-concept site, and, if we could, a framework for making more sites. That clear focus kept us on task.

                        There are so many rabbit holes that are very tempting for developers to jump down -- performance optimizations, adding extra bells and whistles. (Not testing, though, we let the users do that.) But with a well-defined goal, and a project lead to keep us on task, we were able to stay on target.

                        As I said, this was a pretty intense 3 weeks. That intensity drove all of us to keep working.

                        The deadline loomed over us, but in a good way, a way that drove us to keep working -- we all *wanted* this project to succeed.

                        We knew that responsive design was the way the state needed to go, and this was our chance to prove it would work. That desire was instrumental to our success.

                        Code sprints are a great opportunity to explore an area or a direction you've been thinking about getting into.

                        Invest a few weeks to flesh it out and see if that direction works for you.

                        It's also great for picking off those items you know you need but just haven't gotten around to.

                        Need to switch from Subversion to Git?
                        Need to add a JSON option to your API?

                        Find people with the right skills. Be sure to get the right variety for the project.

                        And make sure these people can plan to spend the whole time, not just a half a day, working on the sprint.
